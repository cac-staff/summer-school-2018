Introduction to Bioinformatics for High-Throughput Sequencing: Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and other ‘omics’ methods are transforming the biological sciences, but the pace of development of new technologies can make them difficult to follow. This ‘crash course’ introduces new and emerging sequencing technologies and provides hands-on training with major data types and analysis pipelines with a focus on whole-genome assembly, transcriptome (RNA) sequencing, and DNA metabarcoding.
