This is an introductory course covering programming and computing on GPUs -
graphics processing units - which are an increasingly common presence in
massively parallel computing architectures. The basics of GPU programming will
be covered, and students will work through a number of hands on examples. The
structuring of data and computations that makes full use of the GPU will be
discussed in detail. The course covers some new features available on GPUs
installed on Graham and Cedar. Students should be able to leave the course with
the knowledge necessary to begin developing their own GPU applications.

## Prerequisites

C/C++ scientific programming, experience editing and compiling code in a Linux
environment. Some experience with CUDA and/or OpenMP a plus.
