Python is perhaps the most versatile programming language in existence, and sees
widespread use in every field of modern computing. This tutorial focuses on
Python for high-performance computing applications, and will include topics on
performance optimization, parallel programming, and pipelining. The afternoon
session will focus on using Python to (easily) write and scale massively
parallel data analysis pipelines across a cluster.

## Prerequisites

Please come to the course with some variant of Python 3 installed as well as
your favorite text editor / development environment. If you do not know what to install, we
recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
an extremely comprehensive Python distribution that includes
most key packages you will need.
Please do not wait until the morning of the course to install Anaconda -
it is a very large download.
