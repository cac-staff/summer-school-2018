The R programming language has become the standard tool for data science,
statistics, and bioinformatics. This course focuses on making your R code as
fast as possible, including topics on performance optimization and
parallelization. There will be a major emphasis on newer additions to the
language, in particular, the “tidyverse” set of packages.
Prerequisites

Please come to the workshop with both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. You may also wish
to pre-install the "tidyverse" set of R packages with
`install.packages("tidyverse")`.
