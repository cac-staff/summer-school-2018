This class serves as an introduction to Linux, the UNIX-like operating system
that runs on almost all high-performance computing systems. It is intended for
users who have little or no experience with Unix or Linux. The focus is on the
common bash shell. We cover material that helps the user to develop an
understanding of the Linux command-line environment, which is necessary for
successful use of Unix.

Topics covered include:

* Moving around your system and looking at things

* Writing and reading files

* Wildcards and piping

* Shell scripts, variables, and loops

## Prerequisites

Windows users should install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/).
Git Bash is a minimal bash emulator used to emulate the command line found in
UNIX environments. Mac and Linux users do not need to install anything.

## Materials

Sections 3-6 of [Intro to High-Performance Computing](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/)
