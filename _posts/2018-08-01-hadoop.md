In this seminar, you will learn about using cloud computing
to make it possible to analyze Big Data by providing elastic
resource management to accommodate the application's processing needs. Then, you
will be introduced to the MapReduce programming paradigm that allows developing
parallelized programs using very simple syntax. Finally, you will develop a
simple Hadoop application on Microsoft's Azure Cloud.
